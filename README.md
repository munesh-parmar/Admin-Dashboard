## Explore the Magic

Within this project's realm, you wield the following enchantments:

### `npm start`

The npm start command is used to start your Node.js or JavaScript application. Its specific functionality depends on how you've configured your project and the scripts defined in your project's package.json file.

### `npm test`

Unleash the testing guardian with this spell, granting you the power of interactive observation. 

### `npm run build`

The npm run build command is typically used in JavaScript projects to create a production-ready build of your application. Its specific behavior depends on how it's configured in your project's package.json file.


### `npm run eject`

Beware, for this act is a journey with no return! Once you embark on this path of ejection, there is no turning back!

Should your spirit find discontent with the existing spells and configurations, you may embrace this command at any time. It shall transport all arcane scrolls, including webpack, Babel, ESLint, and their brethren, into your domain. With this, you attain full mastery over them. The other spells, save for `eject`, shall remain loyal to you, though they shall now channel their powers from the copied scrolls, awaiting your alchemical alterations.

Yet, heed the whisperings of wisdom - `eject` is not a burden you must bear. The curated spellbook suffices for many, both humble and ambitious. Utilize it when your heart yearns for customization.
